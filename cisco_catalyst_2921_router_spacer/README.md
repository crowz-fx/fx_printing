# Cisco Catalyst 2921 Router Spacer
Back to [MAIN README](../README.md)

A Cisco Catalyst 2921 Router spacer (90.2mm height).

I don't have a server rack and instead of putting my equipment on top of each other, I printed these spacers that compression-fit onto the router and give it space between the switch underneath it.

Dimensions - 94.6mm (H, whole clip, inner height of router is 90.2mm) x 10mm (D) x 18mm (W)

## Print Notes
- Print with high infill to get rigidity
- Make sure your tolerances are good otherwise it won't 'clip' onto the router
