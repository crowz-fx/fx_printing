# Tablet/iPad Stand Holder
Back to [MAIN README](../README.md)

A very simple block to put an iPad/tablet on to raise the height so it's not sitting on the floor.

Note - I have my iPad in a case which has a stand so you will need something along those lines, this also can be used for anything you want to raise the height of!

There are 2 STL files, they are two different heights 35mm and 50mm

You can scale accordingly, the default size of the STL is 180mm (L) x 35mm (W) x 35/50mm (H)
