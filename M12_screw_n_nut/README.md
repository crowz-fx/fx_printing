# M12 Nut & Bolt
A simple M12 nut and bolt created when testing/learning threads in Fusion360 and tolerances. The .STL's show them upright, slice and print them flat (with threads parallel to the z-axis).

Length of the bolt is 30mm (including head, 20mm is thread).

Thread info:
* GB Metric Profile
* 12.0mm
* M12x1.75
* 6g
* Right-hand direction
